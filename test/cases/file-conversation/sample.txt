# Sample Text Document

This is a sample text document for testing the file conversation feature.

## Introduction

The file conversation mechanism allows AI to read file contents through tools rather than receiving the content directly in the context. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Token Efficiency**: Only relevant portions of files are read on demand
2. **Large File Support**: Files too large for context can be processed in chunks
3. **Search Capability**: The search_file_content tool enables efficient content search

## Sample Data

Here is some sample data that the AI should be able to find:

- User ID: 12345
- API Key: sk-test-abcdefghijklmnop
- Server URL: https://api.example.com/v1

## Conclusion

This document demonstrates the basic capabilities of the file reading tools.
